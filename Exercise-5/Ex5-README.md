# Analysis of Information Networks

## Exercise 5: Link Prediction

### Problem Statement
In this exercise, you will calculate three metrics for link prediction within the Zachary Club network. The metrics to be computed are:

1. **Common Neighbors**
2. **Jaccard Coefficient**
3. **Adamic/Adar Index**

### Objectives
- **Metric Calculation**: For each pair of nodes in the network, calculate the aforementioned metrics to assess the potential for link formation.
  
- **Modeling Link Prediction**: Implement a classification method, preferably a decision tree, to model the link prediction based on the computed metrics.

- **Model Evaluation**: Determine the error rate of your predictions. Investigate one of the incorrectly predicted links and analyze its characteristics based on the computed metrics.

### Data Source
- The dataset used for this exercise is the **Zachary Club** dataset, which can be found in the file `zachary_dataset.txt`.

### Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive report detailing the calculated metrics for each node pair.
- An analysis of the decision tree model's accuracy, including the overall error rate.
- A focused examination of one misclassified link, providing insights based on the link prediction metrics.
