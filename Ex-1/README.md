# Analysis of Information Networks

## Exercise 1: Random Network Generation and Analysis

### Problem Statement:
- **Task**: Create a random network with 1000 nodes and an edge formation probability of \( p = 0.005 \).
- **Requirements**:
  1. Visualize the network.
  2. Determine the number of edges in the network.
  3. Plot the degree distribution on a log-log scale.
  4. Calculate the following metrics:
     - Average shortest path length
     - Network diameter
     - Clustering coefficient (global and average)
  5. Calculate the theoretical values for the metrics (except the diameter).
  6. Compare the theoretical and empirical values.

### Key Concepts:
- **Erdős–Rényi Model**: A model used for generating random graphs, where an edge between any two nodes is formed with a given probability \( p \).
- **Degree Distribution**: The probability distribution of the degrees over the entire network.
- **Clustering Coefficient**: Measures the degree to which nodes in the network tend to cluster together.
- **Shortest Path Length**: The minimum number of edges traversed to travel between two nodes.

### Objectives:
- Understand the properties of random networks.
- Perform network visualization.
- Analyze the network's structure through degree distribution and key metrics.
- Compare empirical results with theoretical predictions.

### Outputs:
1. Network visualization.
2. Number of edges in the network.
3. Log-log plot of the degree distribution.
4. Average shortest path length and network diameter.
5. Clustering coefficient (global and average).
6. Theoretical vs. empirical value comparison.
