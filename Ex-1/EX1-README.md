# Analysis-of-Information-Networks
# Exercise-1: Create a random network with 1000 nodes and an edge formation probability of p=0.005. Visualize the network.
# How many edges does the network have? Plot the degree distribution on a log-log scale. 
# Calculate the average shortest path length, network diameter, and clustering coefficient. Also, calculate the theoretical values of these metrics (except for the diameter). Do the theoretical and empirical values align?
